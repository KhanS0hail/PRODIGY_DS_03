# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 3

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Task Completed

This submission fulfills the requirements of Task 3, which was to build and evaluate a decision tree classifier model. The model predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data.

### Methodology:

- **Data Acquisition:** Obtained the Bank Marketing dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
- **Data Cleaning:** Prepared the data by handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Used `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to encode categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection:** Selected relevant features for the decision tree model based on their significance.
- **Model Building:** Built and trained a decision tree classifier using the cleaned and encoded dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Visualizations:

- **Heatmap of Correlations:** Visualized highly correlated numeric features using a heatmap. This helped in understanding the relationships between different features and identifying any multicollinearity issues.

- **Box Plots:** Created box plots for numeric features to visualize their distribution and detect outliers. Box plots provided insights into the central tendency, spread, and any anomalies in the numeric features.

- **Count Plots:** Generated count plots for categorical features to show the frequency distribution of each category. This visualization was useful for understanding the distribution of different categories within the dataset.

- **Histograms:** Created histograms for numeric features to understand their distribution. Histograms revealed the underlying frequency distribution of the numeric variables.

- **Decision Tree Plot:** Visualized the decision tree structure to understand how decisions are made based on different features.

### Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
